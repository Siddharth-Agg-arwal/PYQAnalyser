      "Introduction\n",
      "This book teaches you how to write programs in a the C++ programming language. However,\n",
      "it does more than that. In the past few years, several major innovations in software develop-ment have appeared on the scene. This book teaches C++ in the context of these new develop-ments. Let’s see what they are.\n",
      "Programming Innovations\n",
      "In the old days, 20 or so years ago, programmers starting a project would sit down almostimmediately and start writing code. However, as programming projects became large and morecomplicated, it was found that this approach did not work very well. The problem was com-plexity.\n",
      "Large programs are probably the most complicated entities ever created by humans. Because\n",
      "of this complexity, programs are prone to error, and software errors can be expensive and evenlife threatening (in air traffic control, for example). Three major innovations in programminghave been devised to cope with the problem of complexity. They are\n",
      "•Object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
      "•The Unified Modeling Language (UML)\n",
      "•Improved software development processes\n",
      "This book teaches the C++ language with these developments in mind. You will not only learna computer language, but new ways of conceptualizing software development.\n",
      "Object-Oriented Programming\n",
      "Why has object-oriented programming become the preferred approach for most software pro-jects? OOP offers a new and powerful way to cope with complexity. Instead of viewing a pro-gram as a series of steps to be carried out, it views it as a group of objects that have certainproperties and can take certain actions. This may sound obscure until you learn more about it,but it results in programs that are clearer, more reliable, and more easily maintained.\n",
      "A major goal of this book is to teach object-oriented programming. We introduce it as early aspossible, and cover all its major features. The majority of our example programs are object-oriented.\n",
      "The Unified Modeling Language\n",
      "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a graphical language consisting of many kinds ofdiagrams. It helps program analysts figure out what a program should do, and helps program-mers design and understand how a program works. The UML is a powerful tool that can makeprogramming easier and more effective.01 3087 Intro  11/29/01  2:23 PM  Page 1\n",
      "OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN C++, F OURTH EDITION\n",
      "We give an overview of the UML in Chapter 1, and then discuss specific features of the UML\n",
      "throughout the book. We introduce each UML feature where it will help to clarify the OOP\n",
      "topic being discussed. In this way you learn the UML painlessly at the same time the UMLhelps you to learn C++. \n",
      "Languages and Development Platforms\n",
      "Of the object-oriented programming languages, C++ is by far the most widely used. Java, arecent addition to the field of OO languages, lacks certain features—such as pointers, tem-plates, and multiple inheritance—that make it less powerful and versatile than C++. (If you\n",
      "ever do want to learn Java, its syntax is very similar to that of C++, so learning C++ gives you\n",
      "a head start in Java.)\n",
      "Several other OO languages have been introduced recently, such as C#, but they have not yet\n",
      "attained the wide acceptance of C++.\n",
      "Until recently the standards for C++ were in a constant state of evolution. This meant that each\n",
      "compiler vendor handled certain details differently. However, in November 1997, theANSI/ISO C++ standards committee approved the final draft of what is now known asStandard C++. (ANSI stands for American National Standards Institute, and ISO stands forInternational Standards Institute.) Standard C++ adds many new features to the language, suchas the Standard Template Library (STL). In this book we follow Standard C++ (in all but a fewplaces, which we’ll note as we go along).\n",
      "The most popular development environments for C++ are manufactured by Microsoft and\n",
      "Borland (Inprise) and run on the various flavors of Microsoft Windows. In this book we’veattempted to ensure that all sample programs run on the current versions of both Borland andMicrosoft compilers. (See Appendix C, “Microsoft Visual C++,” and Appendix D, “Borland\n",
      "C++Builder,” for more on these compilers.)\n",
      "What This Book Does\n",
      "This book teaches object-oriented programming with the C++ programming language, usingeither Microsoft or Borland compilers. It also introduces the UML and software developmentprocesses. It is suitable for professional programmers, students, and kitchen-table enthusiasts.\n",
      "New Concepts\n",
      "OOP involves concepts that are new to programmers of traditional languages such as Pascal,Basic, and C. These ideas, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, lie at the heart ofobject-oriented programming. But it’s easy to lose sight of these concepts when discussing thespecifics of an object-oriented language. Many books overwhelm the reader with the details of\n",
      "language features, while ignoring the reason these features exist. This book attempts to keep an\n",
      "eye on the big picture and relate the details to the larger concepts.201 3087 Intro  11/29/01  2:23 PM  Page 2\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "The Gradual Approach\n",
      "We take a gradual approach in this book, starting with very simple programming examples and\n",
      "working up to full-fledged object-oriented applications. We introduce new concepts slowly so\n",
      "that you will have time to digest one idea before going on to the next. We use illustrations\n",
      "whenever possible to help clarify new ideas. There are questions and programming exercises atthe end of most chapters to enhance the book’s usefulness in the classroom. Answers to thequestions and to the first few (starred) exercises can be found in Appendix G. The exercisesvary in difficulty to pose a variety of challenges for the student.\n",
      "What You Need to Know to Use This Book\n",
      "You can use this book even if you have no previous programming experience. However, such\n",

      "A few example programs draw pictures using a graphics library we call Console Graphics Lite.\n",
      "The graphics rely on console characters, so they are not very sophisticated, but they allowsome interesting programs. The files for this library are provided on the publisher’s Web site,along with the source files for the example programs.\n",

      "The Unified Modeling Language (UML)\n",
      "In the previous edition, we introduced the UML in the final chapter. In this edition we haveintegrated the UML into the body of the book, introducing UML topics in appropriate places.For example, UML class diagrams are introduced where we first show different classes com-\n",
      "municating, and generalization is covered in the chapter on inheritance.\n",
      "Chapter 1, “The Big Picture,” includes a list showing where the various UML topics are intro-\n",
      "duced.\n",
      "Software Development Processes\n",
      "Formal software development processes are becoming an increasingly important aspect of pro-\n",
      "gramming. Also, students are frequently mystified by the process of designing an object-oriented program.  For these reasons we include a chapter on software development processes,with an emphasis on object-oriented programming. In the last edition we focused on CRCcards, but the emphasis in software development has shifted more in the direction of use case analysis, so we use that to analyze our programming projects.\n",
      "C++ Is Not the Same as C\n",
      "A few institutions still want their students to learn C before learning C++. In our view this is amistake. C and C++ are entirely separate languages. It’s true that their syntax is similar, and C\n",
      "is actually a subset of C++. But the similarity is largely a historical accident. In fact, the basicapproach in a C++ program is radically different from that in a C program.\n",
      "C++ has overtaken C as the preferred language for serious software development. Thus we\n",
      "don’t believe it is necessary or advantageous to teach C before teaching C++. Students whodon’t know C are saved the time and trouble of learning C and then learning C++, an ineffi-cient approach. Students who already know C may be able to skim parts of some chapters, butthey will find that a remarkable percentage of the material is new.501 3087 Intro  11/29/01  2:23 PM  Page 5\n",
      "OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN C++, F OURTH EDITION\n",
      "Optimize Organization for OOP\n",
      "We could have begun the book by teaching the procedural concepts common to C and C++,\n",
      "and moved on to the new OOP concepts once the procedural approach had been digested. That\n",
      "seemed counterproductive, however, because one of our goals is to begin true object-orientedprogramming as quickly as possible. Accordingly, we provide a minimum of proceduralgroundwork before getting to classes in Chapter 6. Even the initial chapters are heavily steepedin C++, as opposed to C, usage.\n",
      "We introduce some concepts earlier than is traditional in books on C. For example, structures\n",
      "are a key feature for understanding C++ because classes are syntactically an extension of struc-\n",
      "tures. For this reason, we introduce structures in Chapter 5 so that they will be familiar whenwe discuss classes.\n",
      "Some concepts, such as pointers, are introduced later than in traditional C books. It’s not nec-\n",
      "essary to understand pointers to follow the essentials of OOP, and pointers are usually a stum-bling block for C and C++ students. Therefore, we defer a discussion of pointers until the mainconcepts of OOP have been thoroughly digested.\n",
      "Substitute Superior C++ Features\n",
      "Some features of C have been superseded by new approaches in C++. For instance, the\n",
      "printf() andscanf() functions, input/output workhorses in C, are seldom used in C++\n",
      "becausecout andcindo a better job. Consequently, we leave out descriptions of these func-\n",

      "qualifier and inline functions in C++, and need be mentioned only briefly.\n",
      "Minimize Irrelevant Capabilities\n",
      "Because the focus in this book is on object-oriented programming, we can leave out some fea-tures of C that are seldom used and are not particularly relevant to OOP. For instance, it isn’tnecessary to understand the C bit-wise operators (used to operate on individual bits) to learnobject-oriented programming. These and a few other features can be dropped from our discus-sion, or mentioned only briefly, with no loss in understanding of the major features of C++.\n",
      "The result is a book that focuses on the fundamentals of OOP, moving the reader gently but\n",

      "in the balance of the book. What we say here will necessarily be rather general (although mer-cifully brief). If you find the discussion somewhat abstract, don’t worry. The concepts we men-tion here will come into focus as we demonstrate them in detail in subsequent chapters.\n",
      "Why Do We Need Object-Oriented\n",
      "Programming?\n",
      "Object-oriented programming was developed because limitations were discovered in\n",
      "earlier approaches to programming. To appreciate what OOP does, we need to under-stand what these limitations are and how they arose from traditional programminglanguages.\n",
      "Procedural Languages\n",
      "C, Pascal, FORTRAN, and similar languages are procedural languages . That is, each\n",
      "statement in the language tells the computer to do something: Get some input, addthese numbers, divide by six, display that output. A program in a procedural languageis a list of instructions.\n",
      "For very small programs, no other organizing principle (often called a paradigm ) is needed.\n",
      "The programmer creates the list of instructions, and the computer carries them out.\n",
      "Division into Functions\n",
      "When programs become larger, a single list of instructions becomes unwieldy. Few\n",
      "programmers can comprehend a program of more than a few hundred statementsunless it is broken down into smaller units. For this reason the function was adopted\n",
      "as a way to make programs more comprehensible to their human creators. (The termfunction is used in C++ and C. In other languages the same concept may be referredto as a subroutine, a subprogram, or a procedure.) A procedural program is dividedinto functions, and (ideally, at least) each function has a clearly defined purpose and aclearly defined interface to the other functions in the program.02 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 10\n",
      "The idea of breaking a program into functions can be further extended by grouping a number\n",
      "of functions together into a larger entity called a module (which is often a file), but the princi-\n",
      "ple is similar: a grouping of components that execute lists of instructions.\n",
      "Dividing a program into functions and modules is one of the cornerstones of structured pro-\n",
      "gramming ,the somewhat loosely defined discipline that influenced programming organization\n",
      "for several decades before the advent of object-oriented programming.\n",
      "Problems with Structured Programming\n",
      "As programs grow ever larger and more complex, even the structured programming\n",
      "approach begins to show signs of strain. You may have heard about, or been involvedin, horror stories of program development. The project is too complex, the scheduleslips, more programmers are added, complexity increases, costs skyrocket, the sched-\n",
      "ule slips further, and disaster ensues. (See The Mythical Man-Month by Frederick P.\n",
      "Brooks, Jr. [Addison Wesley, 1982] for a vivid description of this process.)\n",
      "Analyzing the reasons for these failures reveals that there are weaknesses in the procedural\n",
      "paradigm itself. No matter how well the structured programming approach is implemented,\n",
      "large programs become excessively complex.\n",
      "What are the reasons for these problems with procedural languages? There are two related\n",
      "problems. First, functions have unrestricted access to global data. Second, unrelated functions\n",
      "and data, the basis of the procedural paradigm, provide a poor model of the real world.\n",
      "Let’s examine these problems in the context of an inventory program. One important global\n",
      "data item in such a program is the collection of items in the inventory. Various functions access\n",
      "this data to input a new item, display an item, modify an item, and so on.\n",
      "Unrestricted Access\n",
      "In a procedural program, one written in C for example, there are two kinds of data.Local data is hidden inside a function, and is used exclusively by the function. In the\n",
      "inventory program a display function might use local data to remember which item itwas displaying. Local data is closely related to its function and is safe from modifica-\n",
      "tion by other functions.\n",
      "However, when two or more functions must access the same data—and this is true of the most\n",
      "important data in a program—then the data must be made global ,a s  our collection of inven-\n",
      "tory items is. Global data can be accessed by anyfunction in the program. (We ignore the issue\n",
      "of grouping functions into modules, which doesn’t materially affect our argument.) Thearrangement of local and global variables in a procedural program is shown in Figure 1.1.The Big Picture\n",
      "1THEBIGPICTURE1102 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 11\n",
      "FIGURE 1.1\n",
      "Global and local variables.\n",
      "In a large program, there are many functions and many global data items. The problem with\n",
      "the procedural paradigm is that this leads to an even larger number of potential connectionsbetween functions and data, as shown in Figure 1.2.Chapter 112\n",
      "FIGURE 1.2\n",
      "The procedural paradigm.\n",
      "This large number of connections causes problems in several ways. First, it makes a program’s\n",
      "structure difficult to conceptualize. Second, it makes the program difficult to modify. A changemade in a global data item may necessitate rewriting all the functions that access that item.02 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 12\n",
      "For example, in our inventory program, someone may decide that the product codes for the\n",
      "inventory items should be changed from 5 digits to 12 digits. This may necessitate a change\n",
      "from a short to a long data type.\n",
      "Now all the functions that operate on the data must be modified to deal with a long instead of\n",
      "ashort . It’s similar to what happens when your local supermarket moves the bread from aisle\n",
      "4 to aisle 7. Everyone who patronizes the supermarket must then figure out where the breadhas gone, and adjust their shopping habits accordingly.\n",
      "When data items are modified in a large program it may not be easy to tell which functions\n",
      "access the data, and even when you figure this out, modifications to the functions may causethem to work incorrectly with other global data items. Everything is related to everything else,so a modification anywhere has far-reaching, and often unintended, consequences.\n",
      "Real-World Modeling\n",
      "The second—and more important—problem with the procedural paradigm is that itsarrangement of separate data and functions does a poor job of modeling things in thereal world. In the physical world we deal with objects such as people and cars. Suchobjects aren’t like data and they aren’t like functions. Complex real-world objects\n",
      "have both attributes andbehavior .\n",
      "Attributes\n",
      "Examples of attributes (sometimes called characteristics ) are, for people, eye color\n",
      "and job title; and, for cars, horsepower and number of doors. As it turns out, attributes\n",
      "in the real world are equivalent to data in a program: they have a certain specific val-ues, such as blue (for eye color) or four (for the number of doors).\n",
      "Behavior\n",
      "Behavior is something a real-world object does in response to some stimulus. If youask your boss for a raise, she will generally say yes or no. If you apply the brakes in acar, it will generally stop. Saying something and stopping are examples of behavior.Behavior is like a function: you call a function to do something (display the inventory,for example) and it does it.\n",
      "So neither data nor functions, by themselves, model real-world objects effectively.\n",
      "The Object-Oriented Approach\n",
      "The fundamental idea behind object-oriented languages is to combine into a single\n",
      "unit both data and the functions that operate on that data . Such a unit is called an\n",
      "object .The Big Picture\n",
      "1THEBIGPICTURE1302 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 13\n",
      "An object’s functions, called member functions in C++, typically provide the only way to\n",
      "access its data. If you want to read a data item in an object, you call a member function in the\n",
      "object. It will access the data and return the value to you. You can’t access the data directly.The data is hidden ,so it is safe from accidental alteration. Data and its functions are said to be\n",

      "If you want to modify the data in an object, you know exactly what functions interact with it:\n",
      "the member functions in the object. No other functions can access the data. This simplifieswriting, debugging, and maintaining the program.\n",
      "A C++ program typically consists of a number of objects, which communicate with each other\n",
      "by calling one another’s member functions. The organization of a C++ program is shown inFigure 1.3.Chapter 114\n",
      "FIGURE 1.3\n",
      "The object-oriented paradigm.02 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 14\n",

      "nology, but they are used with increasing frequency, especially in object-oriented design.\n",
      "An Analogy\n",
      "You might want to think of objects as departments—such as sales, accounting, per-\n",
      "sonnel, and so on—in a company. Departments provide an important approach to cor-porate organization. In most companies (except very small ones), people don’t workon personnel problems one day, the payroll the next, and then go out in the field assalespeople the week after. Each department has its own personnel, with clearlyassigned duties. It also has its own data: the accounting department has payroll fig-ures, the sales department has sales figures, the personnel department keeps records ofeach employee, and so on.\n",
      "The people in each department control and operate on that department’s data. Dividing the\n",
      "company into departments makes it easier to comprehend and control the company’s activities,and helps maintain the integrity of the information used by the company. The accountingdepartment, for instance, is responsible for the payroll data. If you’re a sales manager, and youneed to know the total of all the salaries paid in the southern region in July, you don’t just walkinto the accounting department and start rummaging through file cabinets. You send a memo tothe appropriate person in the department, then wait for that person to access the data and sendyou a reply with the information you want. This ensures that the data is accessed accuratelyand that it is not corrupted by inept outsiders. This view of corporate organization is shown inFigure 1.4. In the same way, objects provide an approach to program organization while help-ing to maintain the integrity of the program’s data.\n",

      "When you approach a programming problem in an object-oriented language, you nolonger ask how the problem will be divided into functions, but how it will be dividedinto objects. Thinking in terms of objects, rather than functions, has a surprisinglyhelpful effect on how easily programs can be designed. This results from the closematch between objects in the programming sense and objects in the real world.

      "The match between programming objects and real-world objects is the happy result of combin-\n",
      "ing data and functions: The resulting objects offer a revolution in program design. No suchclose match between programming constructs and the items being modeled exists in aprocedural language.\n",
      "Classes\n",
      "In OOP we say that objects are members of classes . What does this mean? Let’s look\n",
      "at an analogy. Almost all computer languages have built-in data types. For instance, adata type \n",
      "int,meaning integer, is predefined in C++ (as we’ll see in Chapter 3,\n",
      "“Loops and Decisions”). You can declare as many variables of type intas you need in\n",
      "your program:\n",
      "int day;\n",
      "int count;int divisor;int answer;\n",
      "In a similar way, you can define many objects of the same class, as shown in Figure 1.5. A\n",
      "class serves as a plan, or blueprint. It specifies what data and what functions will be includedin objects of that class. Defining the class doesn’t create any objects, just as the mere existenceof data type \n",
      "intdoesn’t create any variables.\n",
      "A class is thus a description of a number of similar objects. This fits our non-technical under-standing of the word class . Prince, Sting, and Madonna are members of the rock musician\n",
      "class. There is no one person called “rock musician,” but specific people with specific namesare members of this class if they possess certain characteristics. An object is often called an“instance” of a class.\n",
      "Inheritance\n",
      "The idea of classes leads to the idea of inheritance . In our daily lives, we use the con-\n",
      "cept of classes divided into subclasses. We know that the animal class is divided intomammals, amphibians, insects, birds, and so on. The vehicle class is divided into cars,trucks, buses, motorcycles, and so on.Chapter 11802 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 18\n",
      "FIGURE 1.5\n",
      "A class and its objects.\n",
      "The principle in this sort of division is that each subclass shares common characteristics with\n",
      "the class from which it’s derived. Cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles all have wheels and amotor; these are the defining characteristics of vehicles. In addition to the characteristicsshared with other members of the class, each subclass also has its own particular characteris-tics: Buses, for instance, have seats for many people, while trucks have space for haulingheavy loads.\n",
      "This idea is shown in Figure 1.6. Notice in the figure that features A and B, which are part of\n",
      "the base class, are common to all the derived classes, but that each derived class also has fea-tures of its own.The Big Picture\n",

      "Inheritance.\n",
      "In a similar way, an OOP class can become a parent of several subclasses. In C++ the original\n",
      "class is called the base class ; other classes can be defined that share its characteristics, but add\n",
      "their own as well. These are called derived classes .\n",
      "Don’t confuse the relation of objects to classes, on the one hand, with the relation of a baseclass to derived classes, on the other. Objects, which exist in the computer’s memory, each\n",
      "embody the exact characteristics of their class, which serves as a template. Derived classesinherit some characteristics from their base class, but add new ones of their own.\n",
      "Inheritance is somewhat analogous to using functions to simplify a traditional procedural pro-\n",
      "gram. If we find that three different sections of a procedural program do almost exactly thesame thing, we recognize an opportunity to extract the common elements of these three sec-tions and put them into a single function. The three sections of the program can call the func-tion to execute the common actions, and they can perform their own individual processing aswell. Similarly, a base class contains elements common to a group of derived classes. As func-tions do in a procedural program, inheritance shortens an object-oriented program and clarifiesthe relationship among program elements.Chapter 120\n",
      "02 3087 CH01  11/29/01  2:15 PM  Page 20\n",
      "Reusability\n",
      "Once a class has been written, created, and debugged, it can be distributed to other\n",
      "programmers for use in their own programs. This is called reusability . It is similar to\n",
      "the way a library of functions in a procedural language can be incorporated into dif-ferent programs.\n",
      "However, in OOP, the concept of inheritance provides an important extension to the idea of\n",
      "reusability. A programmer can take an existing class and, without modifying it, add additional\n",
      "features and capabilities to it. This is done by deriving a new class from the existing one. Thenew class will inherit the capabilities of the old one, but is free to add new features of its own.\n",
      "For example, you might have written (or purchased from someone else) a class that creates a\n",
      "menu system, such as that used in Windows or other Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs). This\n",
      "class works fine, and you don’t want to change it, but you want to add the capability to makesome menu entries flash on and off. To do this, you simply create a new class that inherits allthe capabilities of the existing one but adds flashing menu entries.\n",
      "The ease with which existing software can be reused is an important benefit of OOP. Many\n",
      "companies find that being able to reuse classes on a second project provides an increasedreturn on their original programming investment. We’ll have more to say about this in laterchapters.\n",
      "Creating New Data Types\n",
      "One of the benefits of objects is that they give the programmer a convenient way toconstruct new data types. Suppose you work with two-dimensional positions (such asx and y coordinates, or latitude and longitude) in your program. You would like toexpress operations on these positional values with normal arithmetic operations,\n",
      "such as\n",
      "position1 = position2 + origin\n",
      "where the variables position1 ,position2 ,and origin each represent a pair of inde-\n",
      "pendent numerical quantities. By creating a class that incorporates these two values,and declaring \n",
      "position1 ,position2 ,and origin to be objects of this class, we can,\n",
      "in effect, create a new data type. Many features of C++ are intended to facilitate thecreation of new data types in this manner.\n",
      "Polymorphism and Overloading\n",
      "Note that the =(equal) and +(plus) operators, used in the position arithmetic shown\n",
      "above, don’t act the same way they do in operations on built-in types such as int. The\n",

      "objects? The answer is that we can define new behaviors for these operators. These\n",
      "operations will be member functions of the Position class.\n",
      "Using operators or functions in different ways, depending on what they are operating on, iscalled polymorphism (one thing with several distinct forms). When an existing operator, such\n",

      "Overloading is a kind of polymorphism; it is also an important feature of OOP.\n",

      "C++ is derived from the C language. Strictly speaking, it is a superset of C: Almostevery correct statement in C is also a correct statement in C++, although the reverse is\n",
      "not true. The most important elements added to C to create C++ concern classes,objects, and object-oriented programming. (C++ was originally called “C with\n",

      "Our goal is to help you begin writing OOP programs as soon as possible.

      "As we’ve seen, object-oriented programming is a vast improvement over procedural programs.Nevertheless, figuring out what a program is supposed to do requires, at best, considerablestudy of the program listings.\n",

      "show the relationships among classes, object diagrams show how specific objects relate,sequence diagrams show the communication among objects over time, use case diagrams showhow a program’s users interact with the program, and so on. These diagrams provide a varietyof ways to look at a program and its operation.\n",

      "Summary\n",
      "OOP is a way of organizing programs. The emphasis is on the way programs are\n",
      "designed, not on coding details. In particular, OOP programs are organized aroundobjects, which contain both data and functions that act on that data. A class is a tem-plate for a number of objects.\n",
      "Inheritance allows a class to be derived from an existing class without modifying it. The\n",
      "derived class has all the data and functions of the parent class, but adds new ones of its own.\n",
      "Inheritance makes possible reusability, or using a class over and over in different programs.\n",
      "C++ is a superset of C. It adds to the C language the capability to implement OOP. It also adds\n",
      "a variety of other features. In addition, the emphasis is changed in C++ so that some featurescommon to C, although still available in C++, are seldom used, while others are used far more\n",

It also touches on a variety of other languagefeatures, including comments, arithmetic operators, the increment operator, data conversion,and library functions.\n",
      "These topics are not conceptually difficult, but you may find that the style in C++ is a little\n",
      "austere compared with, say, BASIC or Pascal. Before you learn what it’s all about, a C++ pro-gram may remind you more of a mathematics formula than a computer program. Don’t worryabout this. You’ll find that as you gain familiarity with C++, it starts to look less forbidding,while other languages begin to seem unnecessarily fancy and verbose.\n",
      "Getting Started\n",
      "As we noted in the Introduction, you can use either a Microsoft or a Borland compiler withthis book. Appendixes C and D provide details about their operation. (Other compilers maywork as well.) Compilers take source code and transform it into executable files, which your\n",
      "computer can run as it does other programs. Source files are text files (extension .\n",
      "CPP) that cor-\n",
      "respond with the listings printed in this book. Executable files have the . EXEextension, and can\n",
      "be executed either from within your compiler, or, if you’re familiar with MS-DOS, directly\n",
      "from a DOS window.\n",
      "The programs run without modification on the Microsoft compiler or in an MS-DOS window.\n",
      "If you’re using the Borland compiler, you’ll need to modify the programs slightly before run-ning them; otherwise the output won’t remain on the screen long enough to see. Make sure toread Appendix D, “Borland C++Builder,” to see how this is done.\n",
      "Basic Program Construction\n",
      "Let’s look at a very simple C++ program. This program is called FIRST ,so its source file is\n",
      "FIRST .CPP. It simply prints a sentence on the screen. Here it is:\n",
      "#include <iostream>\n",
      "using namespace std;\n",
      "int main()\n",
      "{\n",
      "cout << “Every age has a language of its own\\n”;return 0;}\n",
      "Despite its small size, this program demonstrates a great deal about the construction of C++\n",
      "programs. Let’s examine it in detail.03 3087 CH02  11/29/01  2:19 PM  Page 30\n",
      "Functions\n",
      "Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of C++. The FIRST program consists\n",
      "almost entirely of a single function called main() . The only parts of this program that are not\n",
      "part of the function are the first two lines—the ones that start with #include andusing . (We’ll\n",
      "see what these lines do in a moment.)\n",
      "We noted in Chapter 1, “The Big Picture,” that a function can be part of a class, in which case\n",
      "it is called a member function . However, functions can also exist independently of classes. We\n",
      "are not yet ready to talk about classes, so we will show functions that are separate standalone\n",
      "entities, as main() is here.\n",
      "Function Name\n",
      "The parentheses following the word main are the distinguishing feature of a function. Without\n",
      "the parentheses the compiler would think that main refers to a variable or to some other pro-\n",
      "gram element. When we discuss functions in the text, we’ll follow the same convention thatC++ uses: We’ll put parentheses following the function name. Later on we’ll see that theparentheses aren’t always empty. They’re used to hold function arguments :v a lues passed from\n",
      "the calling program to the function.\n",
      "The word \n",
      "intpreceding the function name indicates that this particular function has a return\n",
      "value of type int. Don’t worry about this now; we’ll learn about data types later in this chapter\n",
      "and return values in Chapter 5, “Functions.”\n",
      "Braces and the Function Body\n",
      "Thebody of a function is surrounded by braces (sometimes called curly brackets ). These\n",
      "braces play the same role as the BEGIN andENDkeywords in some other languages: They sur-\n",
      "round or delimit a block of program statements. Every function must use this pair of braces\n",
      "around the function body. In this example there are only two statements in the function body:\n",
      "the line starting with cout ,and the line starting with return . However, a function body can\n",
      "consist of many statements.\n",
      "Always Start with main()\n",
      "When you run a C++ program, the first statement executed will be at the beginning of a func-tion called \n",
      "main() . (At least that’s true of the console mode programs in this book.) The pro-\n",
      "gram may consist of many functions, classes, and other program elements, but on startup,control always goes to \n",
      "main() . If there is no function called main() in your program, an error\n",
      "will be reported when you run the program.\n",
      "In most C++ programs, as we’ll see later, main() calls member functions in various objects to\n",
      "carry out the program’s real work. The main() function may also contain calls to other stand-\n",

      "return 0;\n",
      "The first statement tells the computer to display the quoted phrase. Most statements tell the\n",
      "computer to do something. In this respect, statements in C++ are similar to statements in otherlanguages. In fact, as we’ve noted, the majority of statements in C++ are identical to state-ments in C.\n",
      "A semicolon signals the end of the statement. This is a crucial part of the syntax but easy to\n",
      "forget. In some languages (like BASIC), the end of a statement is signaled by the end of theline, but that’s not true in C++. If you leave out the semicolon, the compiler will often\n",
      "(although not always) signal an error.Chapter 232\n",
      "03 3087 CH02  11/29/01  2:19 PM  Page 32\n",
      "The last statement in the function body is return 0; . This tells main() to return the value 0 to\n",
      "whoever called it, in this case the operating system or compiler. In older versions of C++ you\n",
      "could give main() the return type of void and dispense with the return statement, but this is\n",
      "not considered correct in Standard C++. We’ll learn more about return in Chapter 5.\n",
      "Whitespace\n",
      "We mentioned that the end of a line isn’t important to a C++ compiler. Actually, the compiler\n",
      "ignores whitespace almost completely. Whitespace is defined as spaces, carriage returns, line-\n",
      "feeds, tabs, vertical tabs, and formfeeds. These characters are invisible to the compiler. You canput several statements on one line, separated by any number of spaces or tabs, or you can run astatement over two or more lines. It’s all the same to the compiler. Thus the \n",
      "FIRST program\n",
      "could be written this way:\n",
      "#include <iostream>\n",
      "usingnamespace std;\n",
      "int main () { cout\n",
      "<<“Every age has a language of its own\\n”; return0;}\n",
      "We don’t recommend this syntax—it’s nonstandard and hard to read—but it does compile cor-\n",
      "rectly.\n",
      "There are several exceptions to the rule that whitespace is invisible to the compiler. The first\n",
      "line of the program, starting with #include ,is a preprocessor directive, which must be written\n",
      "on one line. Also, string constants, such as “Every age has a language of its own” ,can-\n",
      "not be broken into separate lines. (If you need a long string constant, you can insert a back-slash (\\) at the line break or divide the string into two separate strings, each surrounded byquotes.)\n",
      "Output Using cout\n",
      "As you have seen, the statement\n",
      "cout << “Every age has a language of its own\\n”;\n",
      "causes the phrase in quotation marks to be displayed on the screen. How does this work?

Ifyou’re tempted to leave out comments, remember that not everyone is as smart as you; theymay need more explanation than you do about what your program is doing. Also, you may notbe as smart next month, when you’ve forgotten key details of your program’s operation, as you\n",

      "/* this is an old-style comment */\n",
      "This type of comment (the only comment originally available in C) begins with the /*charac-\n",

The member functions are created and placed inmemory only once—when they are defined in the class definition. This makes sense; there’sreally no point in duplicating all the member functions in a class every time you create anotherobject of that class, since the functions for each object are identical.

      "intorfloat ,or they can be user-defined types such as structures and objects.\n",
      "Arrays are like structures in that they both group a number of items into a larger unit. But whilea structure usually groups items of different types, an array groups items of the same type. Moreimportantly, the items in a structure are accessed by name, while those in an array are accessedby an index number. Using an index number to specify an item allows easy access to a largenumber of items.\n",

      "inspired so much perplexity for so many. But fear not. In this chapter we will try to demystifypointers and show practical uses for them in C++ programming.\n",

      "Pointers are an important feature of C++ (and C), while many other languages, such as Visual\n",
      "Basic and Java, have no pointers at all. (Java has references, which are sort of watered-downpointers.) Is this emphasis on pointers really necessary? You can do a lot without them, as theirabsence from the preceding chapters demonstrates. Some operations that use pointers in C++can be carried out in other ways. For example, array elements can be accessed with array nota-tion rather than pointer notation (we’ll see the difference soon), and a function can modifyarguments passed by reference, as well as those passed by pointers.\n",
      "However, in some situations pointers provide an essential tool for increasing the power of C++.\n",
      "A notable example is the creation of data structures such as linked lists and binary trees. Infact, several key features of C++, such as virtual functions, the \n",
      "newoperator, and the this\n",
      "pointer (discussed in Chapter 11, “Virtual Functions”), require the use of pointers. So, althoughyou can do a lot of programming in C++ without using pointers, you will find them essential toobtaining the most from the language.\n",
      "In this chapter we’ll introduce pointers gradually, starting with fundamental concepts and\n",
      "working up to complex pointer applications.\n",

      "The ideas behind pointers are not complicated. Here’s the first key concept: Every byte in the\n",
      "computer’s memory has an address . Addresses are numbers, just as they are for houses on a\n",
      "street. The numbers start at 0 and go up from there—1, 2, 3, and so on. If you have 1MB ofmemory, the highest address is 1,048,575. (Of course you have much more.)\n",

      "How do we approach an OOP design for our horse race? Our first question might be, is there a\n",
      "group of similar entities that we’re trying to model? The answer is yes, the horses. So it seemsreasonable to make each horse an object. There will be a class called \n",
      "horse ,which will contain\n",
      "data specific to each horse, such as its number and the distance it has run so far (which is usedto display the horse in the correct screen position).\n",
      "However, there is also data that applies to the entire race track, rather than to individual horses.\n",
      "This includes the track length, the elapsed time in minutes and seconds (0:00 at the start of the\n",
      "race), and the total number of horses. It makes sense then to have a \n",
      "track object, which will\n",
      "be a single member of the track class. You can think of other real-world objects associated\n",
      "with horse racing, such as riders and saddles, but they aren’t relevant to this program.\n",
      "Are there other ways to design the program? For example, what about using inheritance tomake the horses descendants of the track? This doesn’t make much sense, because the horsesaren’t a “kind of” race track; they’re a completely different thing. Another option is to make\n",
      "the track data into static data of the \n",
      "horse class. However, it’s generally better to make each\n",
      "different kind of thing in the problem domain (the real world) a separate class in the program.One advantage of this is that it’s easier to use the classes in other contexts, such as using thetrack to race cars instead of horses.\n",
      "How will the \n",
      "horse objects and the track object communicate? (Or in UML terms, what will\n",

      "printf() andscanf() ,and—for files— fprintf() ,\n",
      "fscanf() ,and so on.\n",
      "One reason is simplicity. If you’ve ever used a %dformatting character when you should have\n",
      "used a %finprintf() ,you’ll appreciate this. There are no such formatting characters in\n",
      "streams, since each object already knows how to display itself. This removes a major source oferrors.\n",
      "Another reason is that you can overload existing operators and functions, such as the insertion\n",
      "(\n",
      "<<) and extraction ( >>) operators, to work with classes that you create. This makes your own\n",
      "classes work in the same way as the built-in types, which again makes programming easier andmore error free (not to mention more aesthetically satisfying).\n",
      "You may wonder whether stream I/O is important if you plan to program in an environment\n",
      "with a graphical user interface such as Windows, where direct text output to the screen is not\n",
      "used. Do you still need to know about C++ streams? Yes, because they are the best way towrite data to files, and also to format data in memory for later use in text input/output windowsand other GUI elements.\n",

      "C++ are associated with objects of various classes, typically ofstream for output, ifstream for\n",
      "input, and fstream for both input and output. Member functions of these or base classes are\n",
      "used to perform I/O operations. Such operators and functions as <<,put() ,and write() are\n",
      "used for output, while >>,get() ,and read() are used for input.\n",
      "Theread() andwrite() functions work in binary mode, so entire objects can be saved to disk\n",
      "no matter what sort of data they contain. Single objects can be stored, as can arrays or other datastructures of many objects. File I/O can be handled by member functions. This can be the respon-sibility of individual objects, or the class itself can handle I/O using static member functions.\n",
      "A check for error conditions should be made after each file operation. The file object itself\n",
      "takes on a value of 0 if an error occurred. Also, several member functions can be used to deter-mine specific kinds of errors. The extraction operator \n",

      "those chapters all consisted of a single file. Now let’s look at program organization from awider perspective, involving multiple files. We’ll see how communication is carried out amongfiles, and how header files fit into the picture.\n",

      "Reasons for Multifile Programs\n",
      "There are several reasons for using multifile programs. These include the use of class libraries,the organization of programmers working on a project, and the conceptual design of a pro-gram. Let’s reflect briefly on these issues.\n",
      "Class Libraries\n",
      "In traditional procedure-oriented languages it has long been customary for software vendors tofurnish libraries of functions. Other programmers then combine these libraries with their owncustom-written routines to create an application for the end user.\n",
      "Libraries provide ready-made functions for a wide variety of fields. For instance, a vendor\n",
      "might supply a library of functions for handling statistics calculations, or one for advancedmemory management.\n",
      "Since C++ is organized around classes rather than functions, it’s not surprising that libraries for\n",
      "C++ programs consist of classes. What may be surprising is how much better a class library isthan an old-fashioned function library. Because classes encapsulate both data and functions,and because they more closely model objects in real life, the interface between a class libraryand the application that makes use of it can be much cleaner than that provided by a functionlibrary.\n",
      "For these reasons class libraries assume a more important role in C++ programming than func-\n",
      "tion libraries do in traditional programming. A class library can take over a greater portion of\n",
      "the programming burden. An applications programmer, if the right class library is available,may find that only a minimal amount of programming is necessary to create a final product.Also, as more and more class libraries are created, the chances of finding one that solves yourparticular programming problem continues to increase.14 3087 CH13  11/29/01  2:24 PM  Page 634\n",

      "Exceptions and Class Libraries\n",
      "An important problem solved by exceptions is that of errors in class libraries. A library routine\n",

      "routine was written by a different person at a different time than was the program that called it.What the library routine needs to do is pass the error along to whatever program called it, say-ing in effect, “There’s been an error. I don’t know what you want to do about it, but here it is.”\n",
      "The calling program can thus handle the error as it sees fit.\n",
      "The exception mechanism provides this capability because exceptions are transmitted up\n",
      "through nested functions until a catch block is encountered. The throw statement may be in alibrary routine, but the catch block can be in the program that knows how to deal with theerror.\n",
      "If you’re writing a class library, you should cause it to throw exceptions for anything that could\n",
      "cause problems to the program using it. If you’re writing a program that uses a class library,you should provide try and catch blocks for any exceptions that it throws.\n",
      "Not for Every Situation\n",
      "Exceptions should not be used for every kind of error. They impose a certain overhead in termsof program size and (when an exception occurs) time. For example, exceptions should proba-bly not be used for user input errors (such as inserting letters into numerical input) that are eas-ily detectable by the program. Instead the program should use normal decisions and loops tocheck the user’s input and ask the user to try again if necessary.\n",
      "Destructors Called Automatically\n",
      "The exception mechanism is surprisingly sophisticated. When an exception is thrown, adestructor is called automatically for any object that was created by the code up to that point inthe try block. This is necessary because the application won’t know which statement caused\n",
      "the exception, and if it wants to recover from the error, it will (at the very least) need to startover at the top of the try block. The exception mechanism guarantees that the code in the try\n",

      "Handling Exceptions\n",
      "After you catch an exception, you will sometimes want to terminate your application. Theexception mechanism gives you a chance to indicate the source of the error to the user, and to\n",

      "resources, such as memory, that such objects may be using.\n",
      "In other cases you will not want to terminate your program. Perhaps your program can figure\n",

When the program runs, you will either waste space inmemory by not filling the array, or elicit an error message (or even blow up the program) byrunning out of space. The STL provides the vector container to avoid these difficulties.\n",
      "Here’s another problem with arrays. Say you’re storing employee records, and you’ve arrangedthem in alphabetical order by the employee’s last name. If you now want to insert a newemployee whose name starts with L, you must move all the employees from M to Z to makeroom. This can be very time-consuming.

A deque combines these approaches so you can insert or deletedata from either end. The word deque is derived from Double-Ended QUEue.

In this chapter we’ll look atone such process (or at least a very condensed version of it). Then we’ll show how this processmight be applied to an actual program.\n",

      "Evolution of the Software Development Processes\n",
      "The idea of a process for developing software has evolved slowly over decades of computer\n",
      "use. We’ll summarize it very briefly.\n",
      "The Seat-of-the-Pants Process\n",
      "In the early days there was hardly any process at all. The programmer would discuss the situa-tion with potential users and then immediately start writing code. This was satisfactory for verysmall programs.\n",
      "The Waterfall Process\n",
      "Later, as programs grew larger, the development process was broken up into several phases,which were carried out in sequence. This approach was derived from the manufacturing indus-try. The phases were labelled something like analysis, design, coding, and deployment. Thiswas o ften called the waterfall process, because the sequence ran in one direction, from analysis\n",
      "to deployment, as shown in Figure 16.1. Typically, separate teams of workers were used foreach phase. After each phase was completed, its results were passed on to a different team.\n",
      "Experience showed that there were major problems with the waterfall approach. The underly-\n",
      "ing assumption was that each phase would be completed with no (or at least only minor)errors. This seldom happened in the real world. There were usually serious mistakes or omis-sions in each phase. These mistakes would snowball from each phase to the next, renderingsome or all of the work in succeeding phases either useless or similarly error-ridden.\n",
      "Also, during the course of development, the needs of the system’s users might change, requir-\n",
      "ing the program to have additional features. However, once the design phase was completed, itwas difficult to change the design. This meant that the program was already at least partially\n",
      "obsolete as it was being coded.17 3087 CH16  11/29/01  2:20 PM  Page 802\n",

      "Object-Oriented Programming\n",
      "As we mentioned in Chapter 1, “The Big Picture,” object-oriented programming itself was created\n",
      "to solve some of the problems inherent in the development of large programs. Certainly OOP helpsthe design process because objects in the program correspond with objects in the user’s world.\n",
      "However, OOP by itself does not tell us what the program should do; it comes into play only\n",
      "after the project’s goals have been determined. We need an initial phase that focuses on the program’s users and captures their needs. Once this is accomplished we can translate it into an\n",
      "object-oriented program design. But how do we perform the initial step of figuring out what theusers really need?\n",
      "Modern Processes\n",
      "A large number of software development processes have appeared in recent years. They specifythe steps in the process and the way clients, analysts, designers and programmers should worktogether. To date, no one system has reached the sort of universal acceptance that the UML hasin the field of modeling languages. In fact, many experts do not believe that any one develop-ment process can be appropriate in every situation. Even when a particular process is chosen, itmay need to be modified more or less drastically, depending on the project it is applied to.However, as an example of a modern development process, we will examine some of the high-lights of what we’ll call the Unified Process.

      "The Unified Process was developed by the same people who created the UML: Grady Booch,\n",
      "Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh. It is sometimes called the Rational Unified Process (afterthe name of the company where it was developed) or the Unified Software DevelopmentProcess.\n",
      "The Unified Process is divided into four phases:\n",

      "All four phases may be divided into a number of parts called iterations . The construction phase\n",

      "not just to object-oriented languages. In fact, a potential weakness of this pocess is that it does\n",
      "not actively encourage object-oriented design.\n",
      "The elaboration phase of the Unified Process usually begins with a technique called use case\n",

      "Use Case Modeling\n",
      "Use case modeling allows future users of a software system as much input as possible into its\n",
      "design. It uses the vocabulary of the users, not programmers. This focus on users means thatthe initial specification of the program can be understood both by its users and by the softwareengineers designing it.\n",
      "There are two main entities in the use case approach: actors anduse cases . Let’s see what \n",
      "they are.\n",
      "Actors\n",
      "Anactor is (usually) a person who will use the system we are designing. A bank customer\n",
      "interacting with the software of an ATM machine is an actor. An astronomer inputting the\n",
      "coordinates of a star to a telescope aiming program is an actor. A bookstore clerk checking thecomputer to see if a particular book is available is an actor. Usually an actor initiates someoperation, although sometimes the actor may act in other ways, such as receiving informationor assisting in an operation.\n",
      "Actually, “role” is a probably a better name than “actor.” One human playing different roles\n",
      "may be represented by several actors. For example, in a small business, Harry Jones might be\n",
      "represented by an actor called “salesperson” when making a sale, but by an actor called “book-keeper” when adding up the day’s sales. Conversely, a single actor may represent several dif-\n",
      "ferent individuals. Harry, Jose, and Elma may all be represented by the actor called“salesperson.”\n",
      "Other systems connected to the one we’re designing, such as a different computer system or alink to the Web, may also be actors. For example, the computer system in a particular book-store may be linked to a remote system in the head office. This remote system can be consid-ered an actor in the bookstore’s system.Object-Oriented Software Development\n",

      "In general, everything you want the system to do should be specified by a use case.\n",
      "Scenarios\n",

      "scenario represents a particular outcome when attempting to reach that goal. For example, let’s\n",
      "consider a use case consisting of a bookstore clerk querying the store’s computer system forthe location of a particular book. There are several possible outcomes or scenarios:\n",
      "•The book is in the store and the computer displays its shelf location.\n",
      "•The book is out of stock, but the system gives the customer the opportunity to order it\n",

      "Use Case Diagrams\n",

      "From Use Cases to Classes\n",
      "When the actors and use cases have been identified, the development process moves from theelaboration to the construction phase. The emphasis shifts from the users to the developers.Our first concern is to develop the classes that will be used in the program.\n",
      "One approach is to look at the nouns in the use case descriptions. We want objects in the pro-\n",
      "gram to correspond with objects in the real world, and these nouns represent real-world entitiesspecified by the users. They are candidates for classes, but not all nouns make good classes.We need to eliminate nouns that are too general, too trivial, or which are better represented as\n",
      "attributes (simple variables).\n",
      "Once we have some candidate classes, we can begin to understand how they interact by exam-\n",
      "ining the verbs in the use case descriptions. In many cases a verb translates into a message sentfrom one object to another, or some other association between classes.\n",
      "A UML class diagram (described in previous chapters) can be used to show classes and their\n",
      "relationships. A use case is realized by a sequence of messages between objects. We can useanother UML diagram, an interaction diagram ,todetail such a sequence. In fact, we might\n",
